# about-me
This project is about making a webpage showing my skills with html,css,and javascript. It turns into a guessing game describing me.


Motivation
My motivation was to help me improve my coding skills.

Features
my code implements looping interactable functions that help make the user feel like they are personally involved in the guessing game I created.
